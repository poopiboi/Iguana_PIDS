# Iguana Group - Midway Summary

## What is our data set? (PAD-UFES-20: a skin lesion dataset composed of patient data and clinical images collected from smartphones: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zr7vgbcyr2/1)

The dataset we are currently working was collected during 2018 and 2019 and there are 50 types of skin lesions that were collected during this period. Due to rarity, the dataselection was boiled down to the six most common skin lesions diagnosed at PAD: Basal Cell Carcinoma(BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Bowens disease (SCC), Artinic Keratosis (ACK), Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK), Melanoma (MEL) and Nevus (NEV). 

The six types of skin lesions can be categorized as skin cancer or skin disease:
BCC, MEL and SCC are considered to be skin cancers, whereas ACK, NEV and SEK are skin diseases. 

All the samples diagnosed as skin cancer are proved by biopsy.
